# A real-time and high-precision method for small traffic-signs recognition
This repo contains the official implementation of TSR-SA: A real-time and high-precision method for small traffic-signs recognition.
# Dataset
We use [TT100K(Tsinghua-Tencent 100K)](http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/traffic-sign/), and you need to convert the label format to YOLO format.
# Install
